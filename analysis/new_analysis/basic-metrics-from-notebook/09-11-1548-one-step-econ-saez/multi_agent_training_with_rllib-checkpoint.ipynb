    "Welcome! This tutorial is the first of a series on doing distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Here, we specifically demonstrate how to integrate our multi-agent economic simulation, [Foundation](https://github.com/salesforce/ai-economist/tree/master/ai_economist/foundation), with [RLlib](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/tree/master/rllib), an open-source library for reinforcement learning. We chose to use RLlib, as it provides an easy-to-use and flexible library for MARL. A detailed documentation on RLlib is available [here](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/rllib.html).\n",

    "- Provide reference starting code to perform MARL training so the AI Economist community can focus more on building meaningful extensions to Foundation and better-performant algorithms.\n",

The trainer object maintains the relationships that connect each agent in the environment to its corresponding trainable policy, and essentially helps in training, checkpointing policies and inferring actions. It helps to co-ordinate the workflow of collecting rollouts and optimizing the various policies via a reinforcement learning algorithm. Inherently, RLlib maintains a wide suite of [algorithms](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/rllib-algorithms.html) for multi-agent learning (which was another strong reason for us to consider using RLlib) - available options include SAC, PPO, PG, A2C, A3C, IMPALA, ES, DDPG, DQN, MARWIL, APEX, and APEX_DDPG. For the remainder of this tutorial, we will stick to using [Proximal Policy Optimization](https://openai.com/blog/openai-baselines-ppo/) (PPO), an algorithm known to perform well generally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every algorithm has a corresponding trainer object; in the context of PPO, we invoke the `PPOTrainer` object."
